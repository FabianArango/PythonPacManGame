# PythonPacManGame
A very buggy game of Pac Man

The game was made with python 3.8.2 and requires pygame 1.9.6

This is the third game I made when I started programming. The game have a lot of bugs, spaghetti code, duplicate code and it has a very strange organization (and doesn't have any documentation), so download and play it under your risk.
