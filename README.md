# PythonPacManGame
A very buggy game of Pac Man

The game was made with python 3.8.2 and requires pygame 1.9.6

Some context:
  This is the third game I made when I started programming so the code is a mess and the game have a lot of bugs, play the game under your risk.

If you don't have python installed:
  You can install python, here's his offcial site: https://www.python.org/

If you don't have pygame installed:
  You can install it with pip install pygame (if you have already installed python)
    
THE GAME DOESN'T HAVE ANY DOCUMENTATION !!!
